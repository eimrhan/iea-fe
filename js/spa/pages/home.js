	<h1>Welcome, Here is The Home Page</h1>
	<blockquote>
		I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Just a little
		indication. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just
		how special they are to you. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I
		have more fun than most people.
	
		This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out
		on your spouse. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. We don't have to be concerned about it.
		We just have to let it fall where it will. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. If there's two big trees
		invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and
		have fun.
	
		We have a fantastic little sky! Isn't that fantastic? Let your heart be your guide.
	
		I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown,
		Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush
		trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. See. We take the corner of the brush
		and let it play back-and-forth. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. We have no limits to our
		world. We're only limited by our imagination.
	
		Do an almighty painting with us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to
		others through painting. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Zip. That easy. You create the dream -
		then you bring it into your world.
